Ling Yang is currently a third-year Ph.D. student at Peking University, advised by Bin Cui, Luxia Zhang and Ming-Hsuan Yang. My research interests are Diffusion Models, Multimodal Learning, and AI for Science. I previously worked with Yang Song, Shuicheng Yan, Bernard Ghanem, Stefano Ermon and Jure Leskovec. I serve as a program committee member or reviewer for international conferences and journals including SIGGRAPH, TPAMI, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, CVPR, KDD, AAAI.

I am in charge of a reasearch team and have led a series of works on Diffusion Models and LLMs including RPG-DiffusionMaster, VideoTetris and Buffer of Thoughts, and published a book about Diffusion Models.
